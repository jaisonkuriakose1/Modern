#Modern

Modern is a minimal yet complete, modern JEE web application.

My first encounter with JEE was as nice as a brick in the face. There was no
concise introduction, no comprehensive and easy tutorial to explain you
how to bootstrap a fully working Hello World application.

Granted, Oracle documentation is good, but it's just too much for a true
beginner. There is a ton of tutorials out there, most of which refer to
outdated material. Only few of them mention JAX-RS and Angular.js.

So here we are. A small single page application for you to experiment. Have fun!

#TODOs and bugs

There might be bugs. Your help in finding them is very much appreciated!

There are a few JEE components that I'd like to demonstrate but I haven't yet.
One for all, JAAS.
